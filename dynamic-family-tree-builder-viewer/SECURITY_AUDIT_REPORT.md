# üîí Security Audit Report - Dynamic Family Tree Builder & Viewer

## Executive Summary

This security audit was conducted on the Dynamic Family Tree Builder & Viewer application to identify potential vulnerabilities, data security issues, and hacking risks. The application uses Laravel 12 with Jetstream authentication, Vue.js frontend, and VueFlow for family tree visualization.

## üö® Critical Security Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Authorization Policies
**Risk Level: HIGH**
- **Issue**: The application uses `$this->authorize()` calls but lacks proper policy files
- **Impact**: Users could potentially access/modify family tree data they shouldn't have access to
- **Location**: `FamilyTreeController.php` lines 67, 76, 116
- **Fix Required**: Create proper authorization policies

### 2. Insecure File Upload Validation
**Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH**
- **Issue**: File upload validation only checks MIME type and size, but doesn't validate file content
- **Impact**: Potential for malicious file uploads disguised as images
- **Location**: `FamilyTreeController.php` lines 38, 78
- **Fix Required**: Implement content validation and file scanning

### 3. Missing CSRF Protection on API Routes
**Risk Level: MEDIUM**
- **Issue**: API routes may not have proper CSRF protection
- **Impact**: Potential CSRF attacks on authenticated endpoints
- **Location**: `routes/api.php`
- **Fix Required**: Ensure proper CSRF token validation

### 4. XSS Vulnerabilities in Content Display
**Risk Level: MEDIUM**
- **Issue**: Use of `v-html` directive with user-generated content
- **Impact**: Potential XSS attacks through malicious input
- **Location**: `PrivacyPolicy.vue`, `TermsOfService.vue`, `TwoFactorAuthenticationForm.vue`
- **Fix Required**: Sanitize content or use safer alternatives

### 5. Session Security Configuration
**Risk Level: MEDIUM**
- **Issue**: Session encryption is disabled by default
- **Impact**: Session data could be intercepted
- **Location**: `.env` file, `config/session.php`
- **Fix Required**: Enable session encryption in production

## üîç Detailed Vulnerability Analysis

### Authentication & Authorization
‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Laravel Jetstream provides robust authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- Rate limiting on login attempts (5 per minute)
- Session regeneration on login/logout
- Two-factor authentication support

‚ùå **Weaknesses:**
- Missing authorization policies for family tree operations
- No role-based access control (RBAC)
- Public viewer access without authentication

### Data Validation & Sanitization
‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Laravel validation rules for all inputs
- File type and size restrictions
- SQL injection protection through Eloquent ORM

‚ùå **Weaknesses:**
- Insufficient file content validation
- No input sanitization for user-generated content
- Potential for stored XSS in biodata fields

### File Security
‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- File uploads restricted to image types
- Files stored in public disk with proper paths
- Old files deleted when updated

‚ùå **Weaknesses:**
- No virus/malware scanning
- File content not validated beyond MIME type
- Potential for file path traversal attacks

### API Security
‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Sanctum authentication for API routes
- Rate limiting configured
- Proper HTTP status codes

‚ùå **Weaknesses:**
- CSRF protection may be insufficient
- No API versioning
- Limited input sanitization

### Session & Cookie Security
‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Session invalidation on logout
- CSRF token regeneration
- Secure session configuration options

‚ùå **Weaknesses:**
- Session encryption disabled by default
- No secure cookie flags in development
- Session lifetime could be shorter

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required (Critical)
1. **Create Authorization Policies**

   - Add audit logging

### Long-term Security Enhancements (1-2 months)
1. **Advanced Security Features**
   - Implement data encryption at rest
   - Add security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
   - Implement intrusion detection

2. **Compliance & Auditing**
   - GDPR compliance features
   - Data retention policies
   - Security event logging

3. **Infrastructure Security**
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Database encryption
   - Backup encryption
